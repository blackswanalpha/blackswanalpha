# 🤖🎨 Hello, I’m Victor (a.k.a. *blackswanalpha*)

I’m a Nairobi-based developer fusing **AI, code, and creativity** into quirky experiments. By day I’m a data analyst and UI/UX tinkerer, but I moonlight writing **my own programming language** and teaching computers to learn and play. For example, I built **Mono**, a reactive, statically-typed component-based language (with a Python-based interpreter). I’ve also cooked up AI-driven tools like an intelligent skill-tracker (Milestone) and mental-health apps (Mindy/MindTrack) that *track your well-being* with machine learning. When I’m not wrangling algorithms, I have fun coding classic games in Python (think Snake and 2048) and even a video generator powered by code (Genix).

## 🚀 Projects & Experiments

* **Mono** – A custom language/interpreter I created.  It’s reactive, component-based, statically typed, and even supports generics.
* **Milestone** – An AI-powered skill-mastery platform (like a personal coach for learning).
* **Mindy / MindTrack** – AI apps for tracking mental health metrics and mood over time.
* **Genix** – A generative video-maker using code (built on Manim).
* **SparkApp** – A Python text-editor “with a twist” – it’s infused with AI magic.
* **Classic Games (Pygame)** – I recreated retro fun like *Snake* and *2048* in pure Python.

Each project combines tech and a dash of fun – no two are alike!

## 💻 Tech & Tools

* 🐍 **Languages:** Python (AI/ML & scripting), JavaScript/TypeScript (web)
* 🌐 **Web/Frontend:** React & Next.js (UI work), Vue.js, HTML/CSS (Tailwind)
* 📊 **Data & AI:** Scikit‑Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (machine learning experiments)
* 🎮 **Creative:** Pygame (2D games), Manim (math animation), Node scripts, APIs
* 🔧 **Other:** FastAPI/Django (backends), Docker, Git, Linux tinkering (I even wrote a tool to peek inside Linux’s “brain” of sensors!)

I’m happiest when I’m blending domains – building a UI that feeds a neural net, or a game that debugs my sleep pattern, for example.

## 😄 A Little Flair

* Coffee-fueled coder ☕ and perpetual learner 📚 – always exploring new libraries or AI tricks.
* Keeps a sense of humor: my code sometimes has more comments than sense! 🤷‍♂️
* Solver of puzzles, breaker of compilation errors, and fan of meaningful side projects.

Whether it’s writing a toy language or training a model to tell jokes, I’m all about creative coding and clever automation.
